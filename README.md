# Smart-Scroller-Reloader
Take control of your browsing with a fully customizable auto-scroller and tab reloader. Set fixed or random speeds, pauses, and reload intervals to automate your workflow.
# Features
Advanced Auto-Scroller
Dual Speed Modes: Choose between a Fixed constant scroll speed or an Automate mode that intelligently varies the speed within your chosen min/max range.
Flexible Pause Control:
No Pause: Scroll continuously without interruption.	
Fixed Pauses: Set a specific pause and resume duration (e.g., pause for 5 seconds, resume after 3).	
Automated Pauses: Make scrolling feel more natural by setting a random time range for both pausing and resuming.	
Smart Automation: When using automated modes, the speed and pause/resume timers are re-randomized for every single cycle, preventing predictable patterns.	
Powerful Tab Reloader		

Dual Reload Modes: Choose between a Fixed interval (e.g., reload every 5 minutes and 30 seconds) or an Automate mode for variation.
Randomized Intervals: The "Automate" mode reloads the tab at a random time within your specified min/max range, perfect for avoiding simple bot detection and creating a more human-like pattern.
Long-Term Reliability: Built with the chrome.alarms API, the reloader works efficiently in the background for hours or even days, even if the tab is not in focus. It will also automatically stop if you close the tab.
